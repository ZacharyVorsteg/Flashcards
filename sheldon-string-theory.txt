Practice wants to finish charting quicker - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So you're looking to reduce the time spent on documentation..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Cumbersome documentation with generic EHR requiring too many clicks. Business Impact = Physicians charting after hours (burnout risk, turnover costs $200K+), seeing fewer patients per day (lost revenue). Root Cause = System not built for specialty workflows. OPEN THE FLOOR: "Walk me through your current charting process - how long does it typically take to finalize notes after your last patient?" SOLUTION: Specialty-specific EMA with tap-and-go templates, automated coding suggestions. One provider finalizes all notes in 30 minutes for full day's patients.

Practice mentions physicians are charting after hours - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So your physicians are having to finish documentation outside clinic hours..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Time-consuming EHR work bleeding into personal time. Business Impact = Physician burnout leading to turnover (replacement cost $200K-500K), reduced patient interaction quality, seeing 20% fewer patients than capacity allows. Root Cause = Generic EHR requiring excessive manual entry. OPEN THE FLOOR: "How many hours per week would you estimate your providers spend charting after clinic hours?" SOLUTION: Specialty-specific EMA reduces documentation time dramatically - practices report 20% patient volume increase after switching.

Practice wants to streamline workflow and eliminate duplicate data entry - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So you're dealing with multiple systems that don't talk to each other..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Separate systems for scheduling, notes, and billing requiring staff to enter same information multiple times. Business Impact = Wasted staff time (labor costs), higher error rates causing billing issues, things falling through cracks affecting collections and care quality. Root Cause = Disconnected point solutions. OPEN THE FLOOR: "Help me understand your current workflow - how many times does patient information get manually entered between scheduling and final billing?" SOLUTION: All-in-one integrated platform - EHR, PM, and billing seamlessly linked. Data flows automatically from charting to scheduling to claims. Rated #1 integrated solution 2025.

Practice complains about staff entering the same data multiple times - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So your team is dealing with redundant data entry across different systems..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Disconnected systems not communicating. Business Impact = Wasted staff time (measurable labor cost), higher error rates (claim denials), critical items missed (revenue leakage, patient care gaps). Root Cause = Lack of integration between clinical and administrative systems. OPEN THE FLOOR: "What's that costing you in terms of staff hours per week? And how often do errors from duplicate entry cause claim denials?" SOLUTION: Integrated platform where information flows automatically - no re-entry needed. Improves accuracy while reducing labor costs.

Practice wants to maximize provider schedules and reduce no-shows - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So you're looking to keep your providers fully booked and minimize lost appointments..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Inefficient scheduling processes, difficulty filling cancellations, high no-show rates from lack of reminders. Business Impact = Empty slots = direct lost revenue, staff time wasted trying to backfill openings manually, providers at 80% capacity instead of 100%. Root Cause = Manual scheduling without automation or patient engagement tools. OPEN THE FLOOR: "How many appointment slots would you estimate go unfilled each week due to cancellations and no-shows?" SOLUTION: Appointment Finder, waitlist functionality, automated reminders, patient self-scheduling online. Practices easily add 10-12 more patients per day.

Practice mentions high no-show rates - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So you're losing revenue to patients not showing up for appointments..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Lack of automated reminder system, inefficient follow-up. Business Impact = Empty slots = lost revenue (calculate: avg appointment value Ã— weekly no-shows), excessive staff time calling patients, revenue leakage from unfilled capacity. Root Cause = No proactive patient engagement. OPEN THE FLOOR: "What's your current no-show rate? And what does each missed appointment cost you in terms of provider time and lost revenue?" SOLUTION: Automated appointment reminders via text/email, waitlist to backfill, self-scheduling. Even reducing no-shows by few percentage points adds tens of thousands annually.

Practice wants to speed up patient check-in and check-out - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So you're looking to eliminate bottlenecks at the front desk..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Paper forms, clipboards, manual payment collection creating front-desk logjams. Business Impact = Long wait times (patient dissatisfaction, negative reviews), staff time on data entry instead of patient service, uncollected payments (revenue leakage, bad debt). Root Cause = Paper-based intake and manual processes. OPEN THE FLOOR: "Walk me through what happens when a patient arrives - how long does check-in typically take and how often do payments go uncollected?" SOLUTION: Paperless check-in with Kiosk/Mobile Check-In, shows patient balances upfront, immediate payment collection (autopay, text-to-pay) syncing directly to billing.

Practice complains about long patient wait times - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So patients are getting frustrated with wait times at your front desk..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Manual check-in process with paper forms and data entry. Business Impact = Patient frustration (negative reviews, attrition), reduced front-office efficiency, staff manually inputting forms later, chasing payments. Root Cause = No electronic intake workflow. OPEN THE FLOOR: "How long are patients typically spending in your waiting room before they're roomed? And what percentage of patient balances would you say go uncollected at check-out?" SOLUTION: Electronic check-in (Kiosk/Mobile), balances shown upfront, immediate payment collection. One practice became "much more efficient on the front end."

Practice wants providers to access schedules and patient info on-the-go - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So your providers need flexibility to work remotely and access information outside the office..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Legacy system only accessible from office computers. Business Impact = Inflexibility in planning (provider frustration), delays responding to patient needs, poor work-life balance (can't prep remotely, must stay late at office). Root Cause = Server-based system without cloud access. OPEN THE FLOOR: "How often do your providers need to access patient information or schedules outside of clinic hours? What workarounds are they using today?" SOLUTION: Cloud-based platform with PocketEMA mobile app - secure smartphone access to schedule and patient details anywhere, anytime.

Practice mentions providers can't access patient info remotely - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So your physicians are tied to being physically in the office to access records..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = No mobile/remote system access. Business Impact = Poor provider work-life balance (must be on-site for all work), delays in patient care decisions, inflexibility causing provider dissatisfaction. Root Cause = Legacy on-premise system. OPEN THE FLOOR: "What's the impact on your providers' satisfaction? And how often do care decisions get delayed because they can't access records remotely?"

SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = High claim rejection/denial rates, slow manual billing, coding errors, delayed submissions. Business Impact = Cash flow suffering (money tied up in A/R), direct revenue loss on uncorrected denials, extra labor to rework claims (wasted staff time). Root Cause = Manual billing process without automated checks. OPEN THE FLOOR: "What's your current denial rate? And how many days is your average A/R outstanding?" SOLUTION: Built-in RCM with claim scrubbing pre-submission, one-click electronic submission with timely filing alerts, financial dashboards, automatic posting. Optional Boost RCM services.

Practice complains about high claim denial rates - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So you're dealing with claims getting rejected and having to be reworked..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Claims submitted with errors, missing info, or eligibility issues. Business Impact = Cash tied up in A/R (working capital problem), direct revenue loss when denials aren't corrected or exceed timely filing, increased labor costs for appeals and rework. Root Cause = No pre-submission validation. OPEN THE FLOOR: "What percentage of your claims get denied on first submission? And how much revenue would you estimate you lose annually from denials that never get resolved?" SOLUTION: Claim scrubbing catches issues before submission - dramatically improves first-pass acceptance. Accelerates cash flow, reduces rework labor costs.

Practice wants to manage billing without specialized staff - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So you're looking to simplify billing so your existing team can handle it..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Previous billing systems so complex they required dedicated experts or extensive training. Business Impact = Higher overhead costs (hiring specialized billers or outsourcing), stress on existing staff trying to navigate convoluted software. Root Cause = Billing system separate from clinical workflow. OPEN THE FLOOR: "What are you currently spending on billing staff or outsourced billing services? And how much time does your team spend just trying to figure out the billing system?" SOLUTION: Intuitive integrated billing - charges and codes flow in automatically as clinicians document. One practice doesn't need specialized biller because it's so well integrated.

Practice mentions billing is too complex - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So your billing process is creating headaches for your staff..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Complex billing software requiring specialized knowledge. Business Impact = Overhead costs from specialized billers or outsourcing (calculate monthly cost), staff stress and potential turnover, reduced profitability from high overhead. Root Cause = Billing disconnected from clinical documentation. OPEN THE FLOOR: "How many FTEs do you have dedicated to billing? And what would it mean financially if regular staff could handle billing without specialized expertise?" SOLUTION: Integrated billing system regular staff can use - automatic flow from documentation to claims. Eliminates need for specialized billers, reduces overhead.

Practice wants to improve patient payment collections - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So you're looking to increase upfront collections and reduce bad debt..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Patients confused about costs, front-desk can't calculate estimates, no tracking of payment plans. Business Impact = Incomplete patient balance collections (revenue leakage), bad debt write-offs, lower patient satisfaction from billing surprises, staff time chasing payments. Root Cause = No transparency or convenient payment tools. OPEN THE FLOOR: "What percentage of patient balances would you say go uncollected? And how much time does your team spend following up on past-due accounts?" SOLUTION: Quoting tool for instant estimates, ModMed Pay with card-on-file, autopay, text-to-pay. Shows balances upfront at check-in. Improves experience while increasing collections.

Practice complains about patients not paying balances - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So you're dealing with revenue leakage from uncollected patient balances..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = No upfront cost transparency, patients confused about responsibility, difficult payment process. Business Impact = Revenue leakage from incomplete collections (calculate percentage Ã— annual patient revenue), increased bad debt, staff time wasted on collections calls, patient dissatisfaction affecting retention. Root Cause = Lack of transparency and convenient payment options. OPEN THE FLOOR: "What's your current collection rate on patient balances? And how much do you write off to bad debt annually?" SOLUTION: Upfront balance visibility, convenient payment options (text-to-pay, autopay, card-on-file). Collecting at point-of-service dramatically reduces bad debt.

Practice wants to grow revenue - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So you're looking to increase your bottom-line profitability..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Inefficient documentation and scheduling limiting patient throughput, missed billing opportunities. Business Impact = Practice growth stunted - providers at 80% capacity not 100%, under-coding visits due to time pressure, leaving money on table. Root Cause = Workflow inefficiencies creating artificial capacity constraints. OPEN THE FLOOR: "Where do you think you're leaving money on the table today - is it patient volume, revenue per visit, or both? What's preventing you from seeing more patients?" SOLUTION: Streamlined scheduling + faster charting = capacity for more patients per day. One practice saw revenue increase with 20% volume jump. Better coding capture also increases per-visit revenue.

Practice mentions they're not growing fast enough - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So you're looking to accelerate practice growth and revenue..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Operational inefficiencies acting as growth ceiling. Business Impact = Providers at 80% capacity instead of 100% (quantify: if provider generates $500K at 80%, that's $125K left on table), under-coding reducing per-visit revenue, unable to scale without adding providers (expensive). Root Cause = Workflow bottlenecks in documentation and scheduling. OPEN THE FLOOR: "What capacity are your providers currently at? And what would a 20% increase in patient volume mean for your annual revenue?" SOLUTION: Integrated EHR/PM opens capacity through faster charting and smarter scheduling. Client saw 20% volume increase post-adoption. Better coding capture increases per-visit revenue.

Root Cause = No automated patient engagement. OPEN THE FLOOR: "Beyond the immediate no-show, what happens when patients don't complete their care plans? How does that affect your quality measures and patient outcomes?" SOLUTION: Automated appointment reminders (text/email), appointment recalls nudging for follow-ups, No-Show flags for outreach, lab results/instructions via portal. Closes care gaps, maintains schedule density.

Practice mentions patients not following through on recommended follow-ups - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So you're seeing care gaps where patients aren't completing their treatment plans..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = No system to proactively recall patients for follow-ups. Business Impact = Lost procedure revenue (calculate: % of recommended procedures not completed Ã— avg procedure value), worse patient outcomes (quality scores, outcomes-based reimbursement at risk), empty slots from unfilled procedures. Root Cause = Manual recall process doesn't scale. OPEN THE FLOOR: "What percentage of recommended follow-up appointments or procedures would you estimate never get scheduled? And what's that costing you annually in lost procedure revenue?" SOLUTION: Automated appointment recalls, patient portal for post-visit instructions, flags for missed follow-ups. Proactive engagement closes care gaps and maintains schedule density.

Practice wants to offer modern, convenient patient experience - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So you're looking to compete with more tech-forward practices..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Outdated paper processes, long wait times, inconvenient experience. Business Impact = Patient dissatisfaction (negative reviews deterring new patients), attrition to competitors with better experience, difficulty attracting younger demographics. Root Cause = Legacy paper-based workflow and lack of digital tools. OPEN THE FLOOR: "What are patients saying in their reviews about your experience? And have you lost patients to competitors who offer online scheduling or modern check-in?" SOLUTION: Self-scheduling online, mobile check-in, kiosk for electronic forms, auto-generated notes/handouts, patient portal (APPatient app) for records and bill pay. Providers focus on patient, not keyboard.

Practice mentions negative reviews about long wait times - What's your discovery approach? | CONFIRM: "So your patient experience is affecting your reputation and growth..." SUGGEST IMPACTS: Pain = Outdated processes creating poor experience. Business Impact = Negative reviews deterring new patient acquisition (calculate impact on growth rate), patient attrition to competitors, inability to attract younger demographics who expect digital experience, reputation damage affecting referrals. Root Cause = Paper-based workflow and lack of patient-facing technology. OPEN THE FLOOR: "How many new patients would you estimate you're losing due to reputation concerns? And what would patient experience modernization mean for your growth trajectory?" SOLUTION: Complete digital patient experience - self-scheduling, mobile check-in, online bill pay, patient portal. Competitive differentiator that protects and grows patient base.
